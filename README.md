#JQuery Slideshow

For this assignment you must use JQuery to make a slideshow.

------
###Setup
```
mkdir -p ~/workspace/exercises/rich-browser/slideshow && cd $_
```
------

###Instructions

Slideshows should have the following features:

 - Arrow buttons to navigate between images 
 - An auto-rotate feature that navigates through the images on a loop 
 - A caption for each image
 - A fade in and fade out animation.
 - A consistent height and width, regardless of the size or dimensions of the images being shown. 

------

###Bonus
1. Use JQuery AJAX to get your images from an external API. Try [NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day API](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#apod) or find your own.
2. Allow the user to change the animation from fade in/out to slide in/out.
3. Have captions only appear on hover.
